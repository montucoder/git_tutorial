Step_01:	First of all, locate your project directory by using following command
		pwd : This command tells about your present location/path

Step_02:	Here, we use list command i.e ls command 
		For example: $ ls
			     $ File1 File2 ...

Step_03:	By using change directory command "cd <dirctory_name>"
		For example: $ cd Desktop/git_tutorial

Step_04:	Now, we are in our project directory
		Hence, we initialize git using following command
		git init

Step_05:	Now, we add our files and directory by following
		git add File1 Directory1 File2 ...

Step_06:	Check status by using command "git status"

Step_07:	Finally, we submit our files and directory to git using command -  git commit -m "Type your message"


Sonme more usefull command
